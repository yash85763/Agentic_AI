## Introduction

Auto-CoT (Automatic Chain of Thought) is a powerful and scalable method that automatically generates CoT demonstrations without manual effort, consistently matching or surpassing Chain-of-Thought performance. The algorithm was introduced in the paper "Automatic Chain of Thought Prompting in Large Language Models" by Zhang et al. (2022).

### What is Chain of Thought (CoT) Prompting?

Chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting enables complex reasoning capabilities through intermediate reasoning steps. There are two main paradigms:

1. **Zero-Shot CoT**: Uses a simple prompt like "Let's think step by step" to facilitate step-by-step thinking
2. **Manual CoT**: Uses hand-crafted demonstrations with questions and reasoning chains

## Problem Statement

### Limitations of Existing Approaches

**Zero-Shot CoT Problems:**
- Limited reasoning capability for complex tasks
- No task-specific guidance
- Inconsistent performance across domains

**Manual CoT Problems:**
- Requires hand-crafting of task-specific demonstrations one by one
- Time-consuming and labor-intensive
- Difficult to scale across different domains
- Requires domain expertise for each task

### The Auto-CoT Solution

Auto-CoT shows that manual efforts may be eliminated by leveraging LLMs with the "Let's think step by step" prompt to generate reasoning chains for demonstrations one by one. However, these generated chains often come with mistakes. To mitigate the effect of such mistakes, diversity matters for automatically constructing demonstrations.

## Algorithm Overview

The Auto-CoT algorithm consists of two main stages:

### Stage 1: Question Clustering (Diversity Sampling)
```
Input: Set of questions Q = {q₁, q₂, ..., qₙ}
Output: Clustered questions with diversity
```

1. **Encoding**: Use sentence-BERT to encode the questions
2. **Clustering**: Form clusters based on cosine similarity
3. **Validation**: Ensure diverse question types across clusters

### Stage 2: Demonstration Sampling and Generation
```
Input: Clustered questions
Output: High-quality CoT demonstrations
```

1. **Representative Selection**: Select a representative question from each cluster
2. **Reasoning Generation**: Generate reasoning chain using Zero-Shot-CoT with simple heuristics
3. **Quality Control**: Filter demonstrations based on quality metrics

## Detailed Algorithm Breakdown

### Phase 1: Question Encoding and Clustering

#### 1.1 Semantic Encoding
```python
# Questions are encoded using Sentence-BERT
embeddings = sentence_bert_model.encode(questions)
```

**Why Sentence-BERT?**
- Captures semantic similarity better than word-level embeddings
- Pre-trained on sentence similarity tasks
- Efficient for clustering applications

#### 1.2 Clustering Strategy
The researchers partition questions of a given dataset into eight clusters. Our implementation supports multiple clustering methods:

**K-Means Clustering:**
```python
clusterer = KMeans(n_clusters=8, random_state=42)
cluster_labels = clusterer.fit_predict(embeddings)
```

**Hierarchical Clustering:**
```python
clusterer = AgglomerativeClustering(n_clusters=8, linkage='ward')
cluster_labels = clusterer.fit_predict(embeddings)
```

#### 1.3 Diversity Validation
The clustering ensures that demonstrations cover different types of reasoning patterns:
- Arithmetic reasoning
- Logical reasoning  
- Common sense reasoning
- Multi-step problems

### Phase 2: Representative Selection

#### 2.1 Heuristic-Based Selection
The simple heuristics could be length of questions (e.g., 60 tokens) and number of steps in rationale (e.g., 5 reasoning steps).

Our enhanced heuristics include:

**Length Filtering:**
```python
def is_valid_length(question, min_len=10, max_len=60):
    return min_len <= len(question.split()) <= max_len
```

**Complexity Assessment:**
```python
def assess_complexity(question):
    # Look for mathematical operations, multiple entities, etc.
    complexity_indicators = ['and', 'then', 'but', 'if', 'when']
    return sum(1 for indicator in complexity_indicators if indicator in question.lower())
```

**Centroid Distance:**
```python
def select_representative(cluster_questions, embeddings):
    centroid = np.mean(embeddings, axis=0)
    distances = [np.linalg.norm(emb - centroid) for emb in embeddings]
    return cluster_questions[np.argmin(distances)]
```

#### 2.2 Quality Heuristics

The original paper uses simple heuristics, but our implementation adds sophisticated quality checks:

1. **Question Length**: 10-60 tokens (configurable)
2. **Complexity Balance**: Not too simple, not too complex
3. **Semantic Coherence**: Well-formed questions
4. **Domain Relevance**: Appropriate for the task domain

### Phase 3: Reasoning Chain Generation

#### 3.1 Zero-Shot-CoT Generation
For each selected representative question, generate reasoning using:

```
Prompt Template:
Q: {question}
A: Let's think step by step.
```

**Example:**
```
Q: There were 10 friends playing a video game online when 7 players quit. 
   If each player left had 8 lives, how many lives did they have total?
A: Let's think step by step.

First, I need to find how many players are left.
Started with 10 friends, 7 quit, so 10 - 7 = 3 players left.
Each of the 3 remaining players has 8 lives.
So total lives = 3 × 8 = 24 lives.
```

#### 3.2 Answer Extraction
After generating reasoning, extract the final answer:

```
Prompt Template:
{previous_reasoning} Therefore, the answer is
```

#### 3.3 Error Mitigation Strategies

**Why do Generated Chains Have Mistakes?**
- LLMs can make calculation errors
- Logical inconsistencies may occur
- Incomplete reasoning steps
- Irrelevant information inclusion

**How Auto-CoT Mitigates Errors:**
1. **Diversity**: Different question types reduce systematic errors
2. **Multiple Demonstrations**: Errors in one demo don't affect others
3. **Quality Filtering**: Remove low-quality demonstrations
4. **Heuristic Selection**: Choose better representative questions

### Phase 4: Quality Control and Filtering

#### 4.1 Structure Validation
```python
def has_valid_reasoning_structure(reasoning):
    reasoning_indicators = ['first', 'second', 'then', 'next', 'so', 'therefore']
    indicator_count = sum(1 for word in reasoning.lower().split() 
                         if word in reasoning_indicators)
    return indicator_count >= 2
```

#### 4.2 Mathematical Consistency
```python
def check_mathematical_consistency(question, reasoning, answer):
    question_numbers = extract_numbers(question)
    reasoning_numbers = extract_numbers(reasoning)
    answer_numbers = extract_numbers(answer)
    
    # Verify numbers from question appear in reasoning
    # Verify final answer is mathematically sound
    return validate_calculation_chain(question_numbers, reasoning_numbers, answer_numbers)
```

#### 4.3 Quality Scoring
Each demonstration receives a quality score based on:
- **Structure Score (40%)**: Valid reasoning indicators
- **Length Score (30%)**: Appropriate reasoning length
- **Consistency Score (30%)**: Mathematical and logical consistency

## Key Innovations

- **Solution**: Clustering ensures coverage of different reasoning patterns

### 2. Automatic Quality Control

- **Post-Generation Filtering**: Remove low-quality reasoning chains
- **Multi-Criteria Evaluation**: Structure, consistency, and relevance

### 3. Scalability
- **No Manual Effort**: Completely automatic demonstration generation
- **Domain Adaptable**: Works across different reasoning tasks
- **Configurable**: Adjustable parameters for different use cases

### 4. Error Mitigation Through Diversity
- **Individual Errors Don't Propagate**: Mistakes in one demo don't affect others
- **Collective Wisdom**: Multiple diverse demonstrations provide robust guidance
- **Quality Over Quantity**: Focus on high-quality demonstrations

## Implementation Details

### Core Components

#### 1. Configuration System
```python
@dataclass

    num_clusters: int = 8
    clustering_method: ClusteringMethod = ClusteringMethod.KMEANS
    embedding_model: EmbeddingModel = EmbeddingModel.SENTENCE_BERT
    min_question_length: int = 10
    max_question_length: int = 60
    # ... other parameters
```

#### 2. Question Processing Pipeline

    # Make API call with retry logic
    response = await self.openai_client.ChatCompletion.acreate(...)
    
    # Respect rate limits
