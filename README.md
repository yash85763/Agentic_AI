# AI Agents Learning Path

A comprehensive guide to understanding and building AI agents and Agentic AI systems.

## Overview

This learning path guides you through essential concepts, tools, and techniques for building AI agents. From foundational knowledge to advanced implementations, you'll learn how to create autonomous, intelligent systems capable of handling complex tasks with minimal human input.

## What are AI Agents?

AI agents act based on goals set by the user without needing step-by-step instructions. Agentic AI takes this further by enabling agents to reflect, adapt, and improve over time, allowing them to collaborate with other agents and learn from their actions.

## Learning Path Structure

### Step 1: Introduction to Generative AI
- Core concepts of Generative AI
- Understanding GANs, VAEs, and Gaussian Mixture Models
- Advanced GenAI models (Diffusion Models, Transformer-based Models)
- Real-world applications across industries

### Step 2: Basic Coding for AI
- Python programming fundamentals
- Data processing with Pandas
- SQL basics for database management
- API integration
- Building simple AI-powered applications using Flask/FastAPI

### Step 3: LLM Essentials
- Understanding Large Language Models
- LLM architecture basics
- Training and fine-tuning processes
- Exploring real-world LLM examples (GPT-4, Claude 3.5 Sonnet, Gemini, etc.)

### Step 4: Prompt Engineering Essentials
- Core principles of prompt engineering
- Different prompting patterns:
  - Zero-shot prompting
  - One-shot prompting
  - Few-shot prompting
  - Role-based prompting
- Advanced techniques like Chain of Thought and Self-Consistency

### Step 5: Introduction to LangChain
- Core LangChain components
- LangChain Expression Language (LCEL)
- Creating prompt templates and parsers
- Building conversational applications
