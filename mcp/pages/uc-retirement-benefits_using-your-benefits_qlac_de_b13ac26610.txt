Taylor
Retired Technician, age 68
Needs: Stability of assets, simplified decision-making, and income security
Choice: Single Life
"When I retired a few years ago, I felt confident that I could invest wisely and manage my savings withdrawals to carry me through retirement.
Since retiring, I'm realizing that it's harder than I thought, especially with increased volatility of the investment markets. I'd rather make complex financial decisions now, so I like being able to plan ahead with Deferred Lifetime Income. It will supplement Social Security, my only other source of income, when payments start in 10 years."
Akira
Professor, age 67
Needs: Estate planning
Choice: Single Life
"My UCRP benefit will meet most of my spending needs throughout retirement. My concern is passing along my assets to my two adult children through estate planning.
I have a solid balance in my UC 403(b) Plan. But when I reach 73, I'll have to start taking required minimum distributions (RMDs) from it.
Using some of my 403(b) money to buy Deferred Lifetime Income fits nicely with my estate plan because it reduces the RMD amount I'll have to take out of my 403(b), hopefully leaving more money to pass on to my kids."
Kris
Retired Nurse, age 65
Needs: Stability of assets and income security
Choice: 50% Joint & Survivor
"My spouse and I are retired, and my pension, our retirement savings, and our Social Security benefits provide us with income. But I worry about market volatility affecting our savings and not having stability with our income.
We were interested to hear about the Deferred Lifetime Income option, because a lot of our money is subject to the fluctuations of the investment markets. The annuity income isn’t affected by the investment markets and could provide needed security.”
Jay
Health and Sciences Professor, age 63
Needs: Simplified decision-making and spousal income
Choice: 75% Joint & Survivor
"I will retire this year after 20 years at UC and expect my UCRP benefit will replace about half of my base pay. So, I'll need more income to cover my expected expenses in retirement.
I've always planned to purchase an annuity to provide additional retirement income, but with so many products and insurers, it’s been a bit overwhelming. That's why I was excited to learn about Deferred Lifetime Income. The insurer has been vetted and UC makes the process easier by enabling us to use some of my pretax DC Plan money to purchase an annuity. Knowing that my spouse will have additional income if they outlive me brings real peace of mind."
Terry
Administrative Assistant, age 64
Needs: Retirement income
Choice: No Purchase
"I've spent my entire career at UC, so I know that my UCRP benefit will replace much of my current income when I retire.
I'm not married and don’t worry about preserving my pretax UC DC plan savings for my children. I will use those savings for special purchases like a car or vacations.
I decided that Deferred Lifetime Income wasn't for me, since I feel confident that, between my UCRP benefit and DC plan savings, I should be able to cover my expenses in retirement."

Important disclosures
Deferred Lifetime Income is a type of deferred income annuity, called a "qualified longevity annuity contract" (QLAC) which is an insurance product that pays lifetime income starting on a future date, in return for a lump-sum investment of pretax assets. The income start date for Deferred Lifetime Income is 78, which is later than the age at which individuals are required to begin taking required minimum distributions from qualified retirement plans and traditional IRAs. A QLAC is not subject to required minimum distributions. Participants can contact the insurer directly to start annuity payments earlier; additional restrictions may apply.
Annuity payments are subject to product terms, exclusions, and limitations, and the issuing insurance company's financial strength and claims-paying ability.
Products may not be available in all states and product features may vary by state. Please refer to your certificate.
The UC Pathway Funds, as well as QLACs, are not insured by the FDIC or by another governmental agency; they are not obligations of the FDIC or deposits or obligations guaranteed by the University of California, the UC Retirement Savings Program plans, or the professional investment manager of the UC Pathway Funds (currently State Street Investment Management). QLAC purchases are subject to regulatory limitations. QLACs permanently convert a single premium into an income stream. The QLAC has no accumulation value and cannot be surrendered. Please consult your tax advisor.
Investing involves risk, including the risk of loss.
