Adding a family member to your insurance
When you marry, establish a domestic partnership or add a child to your family, you may add your new family member to your benefits plans — usually within 31 days of the date they become a member of your family. Here’s a list of things you need to know and do.

Enroll your new family member in your benefits.
For most benefits, you must enroll your new family member within 31 days of the date they join your family or meet all the eligibility requirements. If you don’t enroll your family members during this period of initial eligibility (PIE), you can enroll them during Open Enrollment. For medical plans only, you may enroll your family member at any time after the PIE, but there will be a 90-day waiting period before benefits begin.

If you are adding your spouse or domestic partner to your plan, he or she can also establish a personal HSA. A child who is not your tax dependent can also establish a personal HSA.

Verify your family member’s eligibility for benefits.
UC requires all faculty, staff and retirees who enroll family members in their medical, dental and/or vision insurance plans to provide documents to verify their family members’ eligibility for coverage.
You will receive a packet of materials from UnifyHR to help you complete the verification process. Be sure to respond by the deadline shown on the letter or you risk disenrollment of your family members from UC benefits.

Consider changing your tax withholdings.
When you add a family member to your benefits, you also may want to change your tax withholdings. You can do so using your online
UCPath
benefits account.
If you are adding your domestic partner or your partner’s children, the value of UC’s portion of your medical, dental and vision coverage for anyone who is not your tax dependent is considered imputed income and may be subject to FICA (Social Security and Medicare) taxes, federal income tax and any other required payroll tax.
