Vesting
Pension Choice
You will “vest” in UCRP (become eligible to receive pension benefits, subject to plan rules) once you have earned five years of UCRP service credit. You begin to earn service credit for your time worked when you start making contributions.
Your contributions to your supplemental DC account will vest immediately. UC’s contributions will vest after you have earned five years of UCRP service credit or, if earlier, on the date of your death, provided you are actively employed on that date. If you leave UC employment prior to vesting, you are eligible to leave
your
contributions in UCRP where they accrue interest or take a refund of your contributions.
Savings Choice
Your contributions to your account will vest immediately. UC's contributions will vest after one year of employment.
