Eligibility for retiree health & home benefits
To be eligible for retiree health and home benefits, you must meet UC’s general eligibility guidelines
and
the age and service credit requirements that apply to you, depending on when you were hired (see categories below).
General eligibility guidelines
Have a retirement date that is within 120 days of the date you end UC employment (for Savings Choice participants, the date your retiree health benefits coverage begins will be treated as your retirement date for this purpose)
Be an active eligible employee enrolled in either UCRP (including Pension Choice) or Savings Choice
Be enrolled in or eligible to enroll in Full UC employee benefits
Continue health coverage until your retiree health benefits become effective
Retiree health and welfare benefits are not available to those who elect a UCRP Lump Sum Cashout or to those who take a full refund or rollover of Savings Choice accumulations
before
beginning retiree health benefits. A partial refund or rollover of Savings Choice account funds will not affect eligibility for retiree health benefits, or retiree health service credit, as long as the DC Plan account maintains a balance of at least $2,000 (with some of that money remaining in the Savings Choice account).
If there is a gap in time between the date you end UC employment and the date your UC-sponsored retiree medical and dental benefits become effective, you may have to pay the full monthly cost for your medical and dental plans (including UC’s contribution) to continue coverage during the gap period and maintain eligibility.
You may also continue your vision and legal insurance during any gap period to ensure continuing coverage. If you don’t continue vision and legal coverage during this gap, though, you may add coverage during a future Open Enrollment period (if the plan is open). Retiree accidental death & dismemberment insurance can be added at any time.
For questions about eligibility or for more information about these benefits,
contact the Retirement Administration Service Center (RASC)
.
If you enroll in UC primary retirement benefits or are rehired (after a break in service of more than 120 days):
On or after July 1, 2013 (including eligible employees hired on or after July 1, 2016)
You are eligible to enroll in retiree health benefits provided you are 55 or older and have at least 10 years of service credit at the time you retire.
If you retire at age 56 or older, you will receive a percentage of UC’s contribution toward monthly premiums based on your age and years of retiree health service credit at retirement. To receive the maximum UC contribution, you need to retire at age 65 with 20 or more years of service.
Between Jan. 1, 1990, and June 30, 2013
You are eligible to enroll in retiree health benefits if you have at least 10 years of UCRP service credit. If you have 5-9 years of service credit, you are eligible to enroll in retiree health benefits if your age plus your years of service is at least 75.
Before Jan. 1, 1990
You will receive 100% of UC’s contribution toward the medical and/or dental monthly premiums if:
You retire before age 55 and have at least 10 years of UCRP service credit (five years for Safety members)
You retire at age 55 or later and have at least five years of UCRP service credit
UC’s contribution to medical and dental premiums
Currently, UC shares the monthly cost of medical and dental coverage with eligible retirees, up to a maximum UC contribution that varies each year depending on overall costs. Retirees may be eligible to receive from 5% to 100% of UC’s maximum contribution to premiums. This is known as “graduated eligibility,” and it does not apply to you if you became a member of UCRP before Jan. 1, 1990, and have not had a break in service of more than 120 days.
If you were hired or rehired on Jan. 1, 1990, or after, the amount UC will contribute to your monthly costs is calculated based on the amount of service credit you have earned and your age at retirement. The calculation depends on when you were hired.
On or after July 1, 2013 (including eligible employees hired on or after July 1, 2016)
