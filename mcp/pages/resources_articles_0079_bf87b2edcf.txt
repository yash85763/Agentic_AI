UC Pathway Funds
. These all-in-one funds let you make a single fund choice based on the year you expect to begin withdrawing money from your account. The funds provide asset re-allocation based on the fund's target date, growing more conservative as they near that target retirement date.
Note: The investment risks of each target date Pathway Fund change over time as the Fund’s asset allocation changes. Assets held in the Pathway Funds are subject to the volatility of the financial markets, including equity and fixed income investments in the U.S. and abroad, and may be subject to risks associated with investing in high yield, small cap and foreign securities. Principal invested is not guaranteed at any time, including at or after their target dates.
Don’t forget to
name a beneficiary
for your account.
Investing involves risk, including the risk of loss.
