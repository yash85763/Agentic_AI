Fee Policy updates for UC Retirement Savings Program participants
August 1, 2024
The UC Retirement Savings Program is implementing two administrative fee changes for the UC Retirement Savings Program.
Effective October 1, 2025,
the University of California will implement two administrative fee changes for the UC Retirement Savings Program:
One-Time Fee Holiday for All Participants (Q3 2025):
Participants won’t be charged the quarterly administrative services fee for the
third quarter of 2025.
This one-time waiver applies to
all accounts,
regardless of balance.
Ongoing Fee Waiver for Small Balance Accounts (Beginning Q4 2025):
Starting with the
fourth quarter of 2025,
UC will waive the quarterly fee for participant accounts with balances
below $300
at the end of the quarter. If your account balance rises above $300 in a future quarter, the fee may apply again.
These changes reflect UC’s ongoing commitment to fair cost allocation and supporting participants in preserving more of their retirement savings.
No Action Required — Waivers Applied Automatically
The Q3 2025 fee waiver will be applied automatically to all participant accounts.
Starting in Q4 2025, if your account balance is under $300 at quarter-end, the ongoing waiver will also be applied automatically.
What is the Current Fee?
The current administrative services fee is $7.25 per quarter ($29 per year).
How the Fee is Paid
The administrative services fee is deducted from your account balance each quarter.
If you have more than one Retirement Savings Program account (for example, a 403(b) Plan account and a DC Plan account), you will be charged
only one
administrative services fee per quarter.
What the Fee Covers
The administrative services fee helps cover non-investment costs such as:
Recordkeeping for your account(s)
Participant communications
Financial education and tools
Internal UC plan support and operations
