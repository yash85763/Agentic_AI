Investments
Pension Choice
UC makes decisions about the investments of the UCRP and assumes the investment risk. The lifetime monthly retirement income you earn is the same regardless of investment returns.
If you are eligible for the supplemental DC account, you select the investments from
available fund options
and you assume the investment risk. The value of your account can go up and down. UC provides tools, resources, and one-on-one guidance to help you understand how to plan and invest for retirement.
Savings Choice
You select investments from
available fund options
and assume the investment risk for all the funds in your account. The value of your account can go up and down. UC provides tools, resources, and one-on-one guidance to help you understand how to plan and invest for retirement.
Guidance provided is educational.
