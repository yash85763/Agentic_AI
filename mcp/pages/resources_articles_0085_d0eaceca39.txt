Save in more than one plan
It’s important to note that these limits are per plan, giving you the flexibility to contribute to multiple plans, maximizing your benefits. For instance, you can save up to $23,500 in any combination of pretax and/or Roth contributions to the 403(b) Plan, plus another $23,500 in pretax and/or Roth contributions to the 457(b) Plan. That's a total of $47,000.
Plus, if you are age 50 or older, you can contribute an additional $7,500, which means you can save a total of $31,000 in pretax and/or Roth contributions to each plan. That's a total of $62,000.
The DC Plan limit has also risen to $70,000 for after-tax contributions, UC contributions, and mandatory pretax contributions (combined).*

This limit applies to all annual additions (pretax and after-tax) to the DC Plan, including UC and mandatory employee contributions under the DC Supplement, Savings Choice and Safe Harbor plans. Once the limit is reached no further contributions of any kind can be made during the year.
