Estimates are for illustration only and do not guarantee future benefits. Your own experience will differ. Review the Choice Modeler for details about the assumptions underlying these estimates. For example, for estimates of annual income from Savings Choice and from the accumulation of UCRP contributions you'd be entitled to prior to vesting, balances are converted to a fixed monthly stream of payment beginning at 65.
