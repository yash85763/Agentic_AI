Optimizing UC's retirement benefits
Introduction to catch-up contributions
Did you know you can save more in the UC 403(b) or 457(b) if you're 50 or older?
UC helps you save for your future with the UC Retirement Savings Program. Because you have two ways to contribute pretax and/or Roth dollars to your Savings Plan accounts — the UC 403(b) and 457(b) Plans — you can already double the pretax IRS limit of
$47,000
for 2025.
But if you're 50 or older, the plans let you contribute even more.
Regular Catch-up Contributions
If you are age 50 or older and making the maximum Plan contributions or reaching the IRS limit, you can make additional pretax and/or Roth “catch-up” contributions. That means you can contribute up to
$62,000
in each plan in 2025.
Lifetime and Special Catch-up Contributions
As an added bonus, the UC 403(b) and 457(b) Plans have “lifetime” and “special” catch-up provisions that may let you contribute even more. Here’s how they work:
No matter what age you are, lifetime catch-up contributions
for the 403(b) Plan allow you to contribute an additional $3,000 per year, up to a lifetime maximum of $15,000. There is no minimum age requirement, as long as you have at least 15 years of service with UC. Once you reach age 50, you can make regular pretax and/or Roth contributions, regular catch-up contributions, and lifetime catch-up contributions, up to IRS limits.
If you’re nearing retirement, special catch-up contributions
for the 457(b) Plan allow you to contribute up to twice the current year’s regular pretax contribution limit during each of your last three years at UC.
Investing involves risk, including the risk of loss.
