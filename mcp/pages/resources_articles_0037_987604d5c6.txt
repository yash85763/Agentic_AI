What to know about Fidelity BrokerageLink
®
.
Comfortable researching and choosing investments and want the widest range of choices? Fidelity BrokerageLink
®
, combined with other funds on the fund menu, may be appropriate for you.
How does BrokerageLink work?
Put simply, it’s an account within your UC 403(b), 457(b), or DC Plan that gives you access to thousands of mutual funds available through Fidelity FundsNetwork
®
, as well as exchange-traded funds (ETFs).
A BrokerageLink account is not for everyone.
If you are comfortable managing a portfolio of expanded investment choices and
you are prepared to assume the responsibility of more closely monitoring this portion of your portfolio, then BrokerageLink may be appropriate for you.
However, if you do not feel comfortable actively managing a portfolio
of options beyond those available through the UC Retirement Savings Program fund menu, BrokerageLink may not be a good choice.
Remember that it is always your responsibility to ensure that the options you select are consistent with your particular situation, including your goals, time horizon, and risk tolerance.
Fees Associated With A BrokerageLink Account
Before you open a BrokerageLink account, you should understand all of the applicable fees (and other requirements) associated with investing through this account.
Some funds have transaction fees, while others don’t. For funds with transaction fees, these fees are imposed based on how you make your trades. The most economical way to place trades is online.
For a complete list of the fund options and corresponding fees, please refer to the Commission Schedule under the

How To Open A Fidelity BrokerageLink Account
After talking to a Fidelity representative to make sure you fully understand all the details, you can open a Fidelity BrokerageLink account by completing the online application or by calling and asking to have a BrokerageLink Acknowledgement Form mailed to you.
Online: Log in to your account on
NetBenefits
, then click the
Quick Links
drop-down next to your preferred plan.
Select
BrokerageLink

By phone: Call 1-866-682-7787 to speak to a Fidelity representative.
Your representative can either walk you through the process of opening your account online, or send a Fidelity BrokerageLink Acknowledgement Form to your home address. Complete the BrokerageLink Acknowledgement Form and promptly return it to Fidelity, following the directions listed on the form. Please allow plenty of time for the mailing and processing of your BrokerageLink Acknowledgement Form.
Investing involves risk, including the risk of loss.
BrokerageLink includes investments beyond those in your plan’s lineup. You should compare investments and share classes that are available in your plan's lineup with those available through BrokerageLink, and determine the available share class that is appropriate for your situation. The plan fiduciary neither evaluates nor monitors the investments available through BrokerageLink. It is your responsibility to ensure that the investments you select are suitable for your situation, including your goals, time horizon, and risk tolerance.
