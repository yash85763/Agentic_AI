The future of the nation’s leading public university system is at stake.
The federal government’s demand of $1 billion from UCLA would devastate one of the nation’s best public universities, cut off life-saving care, halt tech and economic growth, and reduce educational access.
From medical therapies that save lives to technologies that grow the U.S. economy and research that protects our national security, Americans across the country depend on the University of California.
Right now, we need your help.
We must stand together
to protect our students, staff, faculty, and our mission.
Pledge to Stand Up for UC.
