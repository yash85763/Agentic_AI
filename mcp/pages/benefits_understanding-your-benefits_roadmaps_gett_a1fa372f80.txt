Getting married
Congratulations on your wedding! Once the ceremony and celebrations are over, you’ll want to address some issues related to your benefits and personal information.
On this page:
Enroll your spouse in benefits.
Consider changing your tax withholdings.
Update your beneficiaries.
Update your records with any other changes.
Enroll your spouse in benefits.
You have 31 days from the date of your marriage to make certain benefits changes — add your spouse to your coverage (or yourself to your spouse’s coverage), change Flexible Spending Account deductions, enroll your spouse in life insurance, etc.
Remember, if your spouse also works at UC, you can be covered under your UC benefits or your spouse’s, but not both. If you decide to cover both of you under your benefits, be sure your spouse disenrolls from their benefits.
If you drop your UC medical coverage to go on your spouse’s plan and your spouse loses his or her job, you can re-enroll in UC coverage within 31 days of losing your spouse’s coverage.
You can make this change through your online
UCPath
account.

You may wish to consult a financial counselor to discuss your situation. If you decide to change your tax withholdings, you can do so through
