How your health care facilitator (HCF) can (and can’t) help
Your HCF can help you to:
Understand your UC health plan coverage and patient rights
Define your health care issues
Navigate the health care system
Resolve issues with your doctor, medical group or medical plan carrier
Understand how Medicare benefits coordinate with UC-sponsored medical plans
Your HCF will not:
Provide medical or legal advice
Act as a patient care advocate for services/benefits that are not offered by UC’s plans
Suggest treatment plans
The HCF is also available to speak with campus, medical center or laboratory groups about health coverage and/or processes.
At some locations, the HCF provides educational programs about UC’s health plans.
Other sources of help
Before contacting your HCF, you may want to:
Contact your medical provider’s office.
One of the most important relationships is the one you have with your doctor or other health care professional.
Contact your medical group.
If you are in an HMO (Kaiser or UC Blue & Gold), contact your medical group. Most medical groups have patient assistance departments that can help you find a doctor, resolve billing problems or obtain referrals for services.
Contact your health plan.
Your health plan has customer service representatives who can answer your questions regarding the plan’s benefits.
For benefits, academic personnel, HR and payroll contacts at your location, see
campus contacts

Confidentiality
The consultation offered by the health care facilitators is always private and confidential. Health care facilitators comply with Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) privacy and security laws mandating protection and safeguards for access, use and disclosure of personal health information. Health care facilitators follow UC’s Group Insurance Regulations, the terms and conditions of the plan contracts, and Medicare laws and regulations.
