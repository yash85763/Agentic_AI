UCRP Safety Member – Police and Firefighters
February 3, 2025
The UC Retirement Plan (UCRP) is a traditional pension plan that offers a predictable level of lifetime retirement income and includes benefits for you and your eligible survivors, as well as disability income if you become totally and permanently disabled before retirement.
Membership/Enrollment
If you meet the eligibility requirements and work as an eligible police or firefighter at UC, you automatically become a UCRP member and deductions are taken.
For additional details, including eligibility requirements, please see your
collective bargaining agreement
or the UCRP Safety Member

If you have had a break in service or start to a new appointment and have questions about how that may impact your UCRP retirement benefits, please contact the UC Retirement Administration Service Center at

.
How it works
As a UCRP Safety Member, you can elect to retire and receive benefits at any time after you become eligible — that is, when you reach age 50 and leave UC employment with at least five years of service credit. When you retire, you may choose a lifetime monthly benefit or a lump sum cashout.
Components
One component: Pension benefit through the UCRP based on eligible pay.
Shared contributions
Employer and employee contribution rates are set periodically by the UC Regents and your collective bargaining agreement.
Currently, UCRP Safety Members contribute 9% of regular pay. Contributions are made on a pretax basis.
The total UC contribution rate to UCRP for all members is currently 14.5% of eligible pay.
Employee contributions and the UCRP provisions described here are subject to collective bargaining for represented employees.  Please refer to the appropriate
collective bargaining agreement
, as benefits and other provisions may vary.
Your retirement income
If you are eligible, your UCRP benefit is based on your age, your years of UC service, and your highest average consecutive 36 months of pay.
You become vested in your future UCRP benefit when you have five years or more of UCRP service credit; essentially, five years of membership in UCRP if you work full time. Once you're vested, you can begin taking your UCRP benefits as either monthly payments or a lump sum when you leave UC and are at least age 50. Since your contributions are generally made on a pretax basis, your UCRP benefits are generally taxable.
Monthly payments:
Payments will be made over your lifetime. When you die, your surviving spouse or domestic partner automatically receives 50% of your monthly retirement benefit.
You may choose a reduced benefit over your lifetime in order to provide an additional benefit over the lifetime of your survivor or other designated recipient.
UCRP benefits can be no more than 100% of your highest average pay and may be subject to IRS limits.
If you elect monthly income, you and your eligible survivors may also qualify for
retiree health benefits
.
Lump sum payment:
A lump sum payment is available if you are eligible to retire and have never previously received monthly retirement income from UCRP.
Think carefully before you choose a lump sum payment. When you take a lump sum, you give up the right to other UCRP benefits, including monthly survivor income, and will not be eligible for retiree health care coverage.
Other Retirement Benefits
If you become permanently disabled, Safety members may also be eligible for UCRP Duty Disability (if injured in the line of duty) or Non-Duty Disability Income, both of which can include retiree health benefits and additional service credit towards retirement. Please see the Safety Member
