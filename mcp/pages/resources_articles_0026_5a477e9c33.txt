If your combined balance in the 403(b) Plan, DC Plan, and 457(b) Plan is $20,000 or less, your maximum loan amount is $10,000 or 100% of your 403(b) Plan balance, whichever is less. If your combined balance in these three plans is more than $20,000, your maximum loan amount is 50% of your combined balance up to $50,000 or 100% of your 403(b) Plan balance, whichever is less. Please note that if you have had an outstanding loan balance in one of these plans in the prior 12 months, the $50,000 is reduced by the highest loan balance during that period.

For example, the Prime Rate on January 1, 2016, was 3.5%, which results in a loan interest rate of 4.5%.
