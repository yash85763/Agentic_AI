Making Your Retirement Choice
BACK TO RETIREMENT CHOICE OVERVIEW
Make Your Retirement Choice Election
Eligible employees hired on or after July 1, 2016, can choose their retirement benefit from UC:
Pension Choice or Savings Choice.
Make your Retirement Choice election here after reading the educational resources, attending a class or webinar or speaking to a retirement planner.
Don't wait!
While you have 90 days to make your choice, waiting means you will lose out on service credit and/or UC service contributions. If you don't make a choice within 90 days of eligibility,
you will automatically be enrolled in Pension Choice and the enrollment is irrevocable.
