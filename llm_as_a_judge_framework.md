Love this—let’s design a metrics playbook for an LLM-as-a-Judge stack that’s both research-grounded and practical to implement with OpenAI models. I’ll group things into pillars, give each metric a crisp definition, how to compute it, and why it matters.

⸻

1) Preference quality & reliability (is the judge’s verdict good and stable?)

A. Pairwise Win-rate & Bradley–Terry score
	•	What: Convert A/B wins into a Bradley–Terry ranking to see how consistently the judge prefers one system.
	•	How: Round-robin A/B bouts → fit BT or Elo; report global ranking and per-pair margins.
	•	Why: Strong correlation with human preferences in MT-Bench / Chatbot Arena style setups.  ￼ ￼

B. Inter-rater agreement (Cohen’s κ / Krippendorff’s α)
	•	What: Agreement between (i) your judge under different prompt frames, (ii) judge vs. humans, or (iii) judge vs. judge.
	•	How: Discretize outcomes (A/B/Tie); compute κ; use α if >2 raters or ordinal scales.
	•	Why: A sanity check that your judgments aren’t fragile to small setup changes. Quick κ refresher here.  ￼ ￼ ￼

C. Consistency under paraphrase / symmetric ordering
	•	What: Stability score across multiple re-promptings and A/B vs B/A.
	•	How: Run N paraphrase prompts and order flips; report variance of verdicts and of per-criterion scores.
	•	Why: Directly addresses judge variance and order (position) bias. Recent work isolates position-bias metrics (repetition stability, position consistency, preference fairness).  ￼ ￼

D. Verbosity/position bias indices
	•	What: Correlate Δlength (tokens) with win outcome; compute Position Bias Index (PBI) = P(win|shown-first) − P(win|shown-second).
	•	Why: LLM judges often over-reward long or first-listed answers; quantify and track drift over time.  ￼ ￼

⸻

2) Factuality & hallucination (did the answer make true, supported claims?)

E. Faithfulness / Evidence-attribution (RAG-specific)
	•	What: Score whether the answer is supported by the provided context.
	•	How: RAGAS: faithfulness, answer-relevancy, context precision/recall/utilization/entity-recall.
	•	Why: Standard, component-wise RAG evaluation; great for tracing failure mode (retrieval vs. generation).  ￼

F. QA-based factual consistency (QAFactEval)
	•	What: Generate QA pairs from the candidate + source and check answer overlap/entailment.
	•	Why: Stronger correlation with humans than older metrics; complements NLI-style checks.  ￼ ￼

G. Zero-resource hallucination check (SelfCheckGPT)
	•	What: Sample the model multiple times; inconsistency signals hallucination at sentence/passages.
	•	Why: Useful when gold evidence is missing; detects unstable facts.  ￼ ￼ ￼

H. External truthfulness probes (optional)
	•	What: Run periodic spot-checks with TruthfulQA style items to calibrate the judge/system on common misconceptions.
	•	Why: Simple, well-known thermometer for truthfulness tendencies.  ￼ ￼

⸻

3) Instruction following, intent & plan quality (did it do what the user asked, sensibly?)

I. Instruction-following compliance (IFEval)
	•	What: Pass-rate on verifiable constraints (e.g., “≤ N words”, “mention X 3 times”).
	•	How: Automatic regex/heuristic checks on outputs; macro/micro pass-rates.
	•	Why: Objective, reproducible signal of instruction adherence; can be multilingual variants too.  ￼ ￼ ￼

J. Intent classification accuracy (per routed skill/agent)
	•	What: Accuracy & macro-F1 of the system’s intent tag vs. gold labels.
	•	How: Annotate a sample of real traffic; evaluate the classifier/LLM router.
	•	Why: Wrong intent → wrong tool chain; foundational for agent orchestration.

K. Plan soundness / step alignment (agentic tasks)
	•	What: Judge whether the plan decomposes the task into correct, minimal steps.
	•	How: Structured rubric (coverage, order correctness, tool suitability) scored by judge; or compare to gold trajectories when available; report exact-match@k, step-F1.
	•	Why: Moves beyond final answer to process quality; aligns with modern agent evaluation literature.  ￼

⸻

4) Context usage & topic focus (did it use the right info and stay on topic?)

L. Topic-drift / deviation score
	•	What: Semantic similarity between prompt (and/or gold intent) and answer; penalize unrelated spans.
	•	How: Embedding cosine (prompt↔answer); plus judge-tagged “off-topic” rate.
	•	Why: Keeps responses anchored; especially important in multi-turn chats.

M. Context sufficiency / appropriateness (RAG)
	•	What: Is the retrieved context enough and necessary to answer?
	•	How: RAGAS context recall/precision/utilization; add a judge-graded “Missing-Evidence” flag.
	•	Why: Separates retrieval failures from generation hallucinations.  ￼ ￼

⸻

5) Safety & policy alignment (is it safe and policy-conformant?)

N. Safety verdict & sensitivity
	•	What: Safety judge score (harmful content, privacy leakage, dangerous instructions) + stability under “apologetic/verbose” artifacts.
	•	How: Run safety-focused judge prompts; measure self-consistency and susceptibility to surface cues.
	•	Why: Recent results show safety judges can be swayed by phrasing; measure and harden.  ￼

(If you’re in regulated contexts, track privacy risk findings as a separate audit log.)  ￼

⸻

6) Calibration & uncertainty (does the judge’s confidence mean anything?)

O. Brier score (lower is better)
	•	What: Mean squared error between judge’s confidence and correctness indicator.
	•	How: Treat “correctness” as 1 if human panel agrees / passes gold checks; use judge’s self-reported confidence (or mapped margin) as probability.
	•	Why: Proper scoring rule for probabilistic judgments; add Brier Skill Score vs. a naive baseline.  ￼

P. Expected Calibration Error (ECE)
	•	What: Bin predictions by confidence; compare accuracy vs. confidence; report weighted gap.
	•	Why: Single scalar for “are confidences trustworthy?”.  ￼ ￼

⸻

7) Robustness, cost & ops

Q. Robustness to prompt edits
	•	What: Agreement under paraphrases, synonym swaps, or shuffled context (non-semantic).
	•	How: Δ in verdicts and scores; report % flips.
	•	Why: Detects brittle judging prompts.

R. Latency & cost per 100 evals
	•	What: p50/p95 latency; $/100 judgments at your target model.
	•	Why: Lets you choose between “fast triage judge” vs. “slow high-stakes judge”.

S. Data drift monitors
	•	What: Track distribution of prompt domains and answer lengths over time; alert when outside control limits.
	•	Why: Bias metrics (verbosity/position) depend on the traffic mix.

⸻

Metric wiring suggestions (how to make this actionable fast)
	•	Judgment schema: Every run should log {prompt_id, model_id, answer_id, judge_version, verdict(A/B/Tie or score), margin, per_criterion, self_conf ∈ [0,1], tokens, position(A/B), prompt_variant} to a table.
	•	Ground truth hooks: Keep a small human-judged slice weekly to anchor κ/α and Brier/ECE.
	•	Bias dashboards: PBI and Verbosity-Bias charts (win% vs Δlength buckets). Use symmetric A/B→B/A runs by default.  ￼
	•	RAG runs: When context exists, automatically compute RAGAS (faithfulness, answer-relevancy, context P/R/U) alongside judge scores.  ￼
	•	Factuality triage: If faithfulness is low or no context is provided, trigger SelfCheckGPT resamples; if high-risk domain, add QAFactEval.  ￼
	•	Instruction checks: Run IFEval style verifiable constraints on any prompt with explicit rules (word counts, must-include terms).  ￼
	•	Benchmark “canary”: Keep a nightly smoke test using MT-Bench/Arena-Hard-Auto prompts to detect regressions in judge reliability.  ￼ ￼

⸻

Concrete formulas you can drop into code
	•	Cohen’s κ (two raters):
\kappa = \dfrac{p_o - p_e}{1 - p_e}, where p_o is observed agreement, p_e is chance agreement from the marginals. Use weighted κ for ordinal scales.  ￼
	•	Brier score (binary correctness):
\text{BS} = \frac{1}{N}\sum_i ( \hat{p}_i - y_i )^2, with y_i \in \{0,1\} from gold labels/human panel; \hat{p}_i = judge confidence. BSS vs. baseline for interpretability.  ￼
	•	ECE (M-bin):
\text{ECE} = \sum_{m=1}^{M} \frac{|B_m|}{N}\, \big| \text{acc}(B_m) - \text{conf}(B_m) \big|.  ￼
	•	Verbosity Bias Index (suggested):
Bucket Δtokens = len(ansA)−len(ansB); report win% for longer vs. shorter; regress win on Δtokens for strength.

⸻

Quick mapping to your ideas
	•	“Rerun the judge with more critical reasoning and compute κ” → that’s Pillar 1B/1C above (κ + stability); add ECE/Brier to see if higher “critical” confidence corresponds to correctness.  ￼ ￼
	•	“Deviation from main topic” → L (topic-drift) via embeddings + judge tag.
	•	“Hallucination” → E/F/G/H (RAGAS, QAFactEval, SelfCheckGPT, TruthfulQA spot-checks).  ￼ ￼
	•	“Usage of context / info sufficiency” → E/M (RAGAS context P/R/U + Missing-Evidence flag).  ￼
	•	“User query intent classification” → J; report accuracy/macro-F1 on a labeled slice.
	•	“Planning to solve the query” → K step-alignment metrics (coverage/order/tool suitability) with a rubric judge; for agents, tie to the agent-eval survey.  ￼

⸻

Minimal scoring bundles you can ship first
	1.	Preference-Judge Core: BT win-rate + κ (paraphrase & symmetric) + Verbosity/Position Bias indices.  ￼
	2.	Truthfulness/RAG: RAGAS + SelfCheckGPT fallback + (optional) QAFactEval.  ￼ ￼
	3.	Instruction & Safety: IFEval pass-rate + Safety stability (phrasing-sensitivity).  ￼ ￼
	4.	Calibration: Brier + ECE from judge self-confidence vs. human-anchored correctness.  ￼ ￼

If you want, I can next sketch the evaluation data model + SQL for these metrics and then plug them into the judge code we already drafted (with ready-to-run compute functions for κ, ECE, Brier, BT, RAGAS hooks, etc.).
